# MarkerCapsule: Explainable Single Cell Typing using Capsule Networks

**MarkerCapsule** is a genneral framework for identifying cell types from single cell scRA-seq data. **MarkerCapsule** is based on Capsule Networks, which reflect most recent and most advanced progress in deep learning, automatizes the annotation step, enables to coherently integrate heterogeneous data, and supports a human-mind-friendly interpretation of results, by relating marker genes with the fundamental units of capsule networks.

For more details see our pre-print on bioRxiv:



For running the **MarkerCapsule** please update the dataset and corresponing output capsule. For example to run **MarkerCapsule** with dataset-2, update the number of output capsule (num_caps) as 15.
